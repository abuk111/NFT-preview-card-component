## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS, BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Mentor Challenge, which I completed. Although it seemed more difficult, I had fewer problems with completing it than challenge # 1. The most tricky was the hover action fragment, where the view icon was not transparent but background was. First, I try tu use opacity property, but afterwards I decided to keep it simply stupid and I add alpha challengge to background-color ;)
